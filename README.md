An AI-powered web application that classifies waste into different categories (e.g., organic, plastic, paper) using image recognition.
Built using TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit, this tool aims to promote proper waste segregation and support environmental sustainability.
Features:
Trained deep learning model (CNN) to classify waste
Real-time image upload and prediction
simple web interface using Streamlit
Lightweight and easy to run locally

technologies used:
Python 3.11
TensorFlow / Keras
Streamlit
NumPy, Pillow, Pandas
Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

dataset info:
The dataset consists of images of:
Plastic waste ( bottles, etc.)
Organic waste (banana peels, etc.)
Paper waste (papers, newspapers, etc.)
Dataset and trained model files (.h5) are not uploaded to GitHub due to size limits. You can contact me for access or use your own dataset.
